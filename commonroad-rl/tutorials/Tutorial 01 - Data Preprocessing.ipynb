    "Since an RL training/testing session involves tens of thousands of iterations and accesses to the scenarios, it is a good idea to convert the `.xml` files to `.pickle` format so that they will be loaded more efficiently during training and testing. Furthermore, this script separates road networks and obstacles since lots of scenario could share the road network data.
